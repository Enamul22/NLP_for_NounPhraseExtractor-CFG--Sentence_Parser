# English Noun Phrase Extractor

## Description

The English Noun Phrase Parser is a natural language processing tool that parses English sentences and extracts noun phrases using context-free grammar (CFG). The project leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. This parser is designed to understand sentence structure and can be particularly useful for linguistic analysis and information extraction tasks. This project is a part of my AI coursework, Tampere University.
